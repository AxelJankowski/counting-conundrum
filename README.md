# Counting Conundrum

The game created in Phaser.js that draws inspiration from a game used to study chimpanzee memory. "The premise of the game is that numbers flash on the screen for a brief period of time before being covered by circles. The goal is to then click on the circles in the correct order from smallest to largest."
